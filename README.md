This is web traversal drivers an effort made for the automation testers
    1. To traverse specific set of elements(eg navbar) on webpage.
    2. Snapshot comparison
    3. Find subimage co-ordinates from fullpage snapshot image
    4. Click specific co-ordinate on screen
    5. OCR

This framework is using Selenium,PIL(python image library) and Tesseract to facilitate above features.
I would love to add more features to it so require more suggestions, contribution and improvements.

Thanks
